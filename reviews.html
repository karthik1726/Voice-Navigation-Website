            <h2>SuperTuxKart</h2>
            <h3>Genre: Action / Racing</h3>
            <p>SuperTuxKart is an open-source 3D racing game with plenty of fun, quirky characters and exciting tracks.
                The game offers smooth gameplay, cool power-ups, and multiplayer modes for both online and local play.
                However, the AI could be improved, as it sometimes feels too easy for experienced players.</p>

            <h2>Teeworlds</h2>
            <h3>Genre: Action / Shooter</h3>
            <p>Teeworlds brings back a retro multiplayer shooter experience with cute, customizable characters and
                fast-paced combat. The physics in the game make it stand out, offering a satisfying mix of skill-based
                gameplay and fun mechanics. The maps are well-designed, but the game could benefit from more content and
                game modes.</p>

            <h2>Flare</h2>
            <h3>Genre: Adventure / RPG</h3>
            <p>Flare is an action-packed RPG with a simple, but engaging story. The game features stunning pixel art and
                provides a nostalgic old-school RPG experience. Its controls are easy to master, and the character
                customization offers variety. However, the lack of multiplayer support and some repetitive missions can
                be a downside for some players.</p>

            <h2>Hextris</h2>
            <h3>Genre: Puzzle</h3>
            <p>Hextris is a highly addictive puzzle game that blends fast-paced gameplay with a simple, elegant design.
                The game tests your reflexes and puzzle-solving skills in a fun, challenging environment. Although it's
                free and easy to pick up, it can feel repetitive after long sessions due to the limited game modes.</p>

            <h2>The Mana World</h2>
            <h3>Genre: MMORPG</h3>
            <p>The Mana World is an open-source MMORPG with a classic, retro pixel art style. The game has a rich world
                to explore with quests, battles, and a supportive community. However, the user interface feels outdated
                and the combat mechanics can be a bit clunky at times. Despite these drawbacks, the game’s charm lies in
                its community-driven development and old-school vibe.</p>
